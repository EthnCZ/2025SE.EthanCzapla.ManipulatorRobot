# ECZManipulatorRobot
Task Description:
Design and build an autonomous OOP-controlled manipulator mechatronics prototype for an industrial assembly line. The core function of your system is to use an end effector to pick and sort 25x25x25mm coloured cubes. You can choose between 3 to 6 'degrees of freedom' and design the pick-and-sort zones to suit your system. Your mechatronic system must be able to sort at least two coloured (black, white, blue, green, or red) cubes, which will be provided to you.
